## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
 build an app that tests psychic ability. have the app select 2 random words and keep the selections hidden until after "Submit Selections" button is pressed. Test the user 5 times.  A "Psychic Score" is then given based on accuracy of test. Use a pixel font. At bottom of page show link <a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a>
 . Use only HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Project Plan
```
Here’s a simple and clear **project plan** with main tasks and technical considerations based on the requirements:

---

### **Project Plan**

#### **1. Define Project Scope**
   - **Objective**: Build a web app to test psychic ability by guessing random words and calculating a "Psychic Score."
   - **Constraints**: Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries).

#### **2. Task Breakdown**
   - **Task 1: HTML Structure**
     - Create a container for the app.
     - Add elements for:
       - Displaying the random word selection.
       - Input fields for the user's guesses.
       - A "Submit Selections" button.
       - A display area for the "Psychic Score."
       - The link at the bottom (`<a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a>`).
     - **Technical Considerations**:
       - Use semantic HTML for better structure.
       - Ensure accessibility (e.g., `label` for input fields).

   - **Task 2: CSS Styling**
     - Use a pixel font (e.g., `"Press Start 2P"` from Google Fonts).
     - Style the app with a retro, clean design.
     - **Technical Considerations**:
       - Import the pixel font using Google Fonts.
       - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout.
       - Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.

   - **Task 3: JavaScript Logic**
     - Create an array of words for random selection.
     - Implement logic to:
       - Randomly select 2 words and hide them.
       - Allow the user to input their guesses.
       - Compare the user's input with the hidden words.
       - Calculate accuracy and display the "Psychic Score."
       - Repeat the test 5 times.
     - **Technical Considerations**:
       - Use JavaScript functions to handle randomization, comparison, and scoring.
       - Ensure the app resets correctly for each of the 5 tests.

   - **Task 4: Testing**
     - Test the app for functionality, responsiveness, and edge cases.
     - **Technical Considerations**:
       - Check for errors in word selection, scoring, and button functionality.
       - Test on different browsers and devices.

   - **Task 5: Deployment**
     - Host the app on a free service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
     - **Technical Considerations**:
       - Ensure all files are properly linked (HTML, CSS, JS).

---

#### **3. Timeline**
   - **Day 1**: HTML Structure and basic CSS.
   - **Day 2**: JavaScript logic implementation.
   - **Day 3**: Testing and debugging.
   - **Day 4**: Final styling and deployment.

---

#### **4. Deliverables**
   - A single-page web app with the following:
     - Functional psychic ability test.
     - Retro pixel-themed design.
     - "Psychic Score" calculation.
     - Fully responsive and accessible.
